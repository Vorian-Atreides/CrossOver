# Server

## How to install

The installation should be pretty simple,
you will require to have Docker:
> https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

and Docker-Compose (version 2):
> https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

## Database configuration

The database is hosted and configured in a docker's container.
You can find the SQL script used to generate the database at:
> ./resources/init.sql

But you shouldn't have to use it.

## Assumptions

In the current project, I assumed the clients' computers:
- were safe and thrusted
- their key were unique
- isn't on a specific Operating System
- HTTP header's weren't required.

## Requirements not covered

There are some requirements which haven't been covered:
- I don't use an HTTP protocol
- The smtp server doesn't send the emails

## How to build

Your only task would be to launch docker:
> docker-compose up standalone

## Issues

I faced several issues, slowing down the development progress:
- hardness to find a good library
- configuration issues with smtp container

## Feedback

The exercise is really good and the project is well designed
to try several fields. But it would have been bettter to have
a configured environment (DBMS, SMTP server).

I actually spent a huge amount of my time configuring the infrastructure
instead of developing the software and the communication itself.
And I assume those parts aren't really in the scope of the exercise.

Scaling the project to a 2 days project instead of 3 would be better,
specially if you have to work.

# Client

## How to install

The installation will be a bit more troublesome than for the server.
The Cmake is currently configured to work on Mac and UNIX
but the project should be independant.

Firstly you should install cmake (version 3 at least):
> https://cmake.org/

The project require to have C++ (version 11 at least):
> https://gcc.gnu.org/

For the network communication, you will need ZeroMQ:
> http://zeromq.org/area:download

And its CPP's binding:
> https://github.com/zeromq/zmqpp

For the serialization the message, you will require the google ProtocolBuffer:
> https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

And finaly, to analyse the computer's system in any platform,
you will need to build and install Sigar API:
> https://github.com/hyperic/sigar 

## Database configuration

There aren't any database for this project.

## Assumptions

In the current project, I assumed the clients' computers:
- were safe and thrusted
- their key were unique
- isn't on a specific Operating System
- HTTP headers weren't required

## Requirements not covered

There are one requirement which hasn't been covered:
- I don't use an HTTP protocol
- The messages and errors aren't logged.

## How to build

To build the project, I would recommand to follow those step:
> mkdir build

> cd build/

> cmake ..

> make

## Issues

The main issue was to find a good cross platform library to analyse the system.
And actually the Sigar API's website was down.

## Feedback

A good project, maybe specifying in the requirements if the project
must be cross platform or platform specific. I did waste a bit of time wondering for which platform to develop.

Scaling the project to a 2 days project instead of 3 would be better,
specially if you have to work.
